      <h1 id="title">Here's the story of Martin Luther King</h1>
      <div id="tribute-info">
        <p>came from a comfortable middle-class family steeped in the
          tradition of the Southern Black ministry: both his father and maternal
          grandfather were Baptist preachers. His parents were college-educated,
          and King’s father had succeeded his father-in-law as pastor of the
          prestigious Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta.</p> 
          <p>The family lived on
            Auburn Avenue, otherwise known as “Sweet Auburn,” the bustling “Black
            Wall Street,” home to some of the country’s largest and most prosperous
            Black businesses and Black churches in the years before the civil rights
            movement. Young Martin received a solid education and grew up in a
            loving extended family. This secure upbringing, however, did not prevent
            King from experiencing the prejudices then common in the South.</p> 
            <p> He never
              forgot the time when, at about age six, one of his white playmates
              announced that his parents would no longer allow him to play with King,
              because the children were now attending segregated schools. Dearest to
              King in these early years was his maternal grandmother, whose death in
              1941 left him shaken and unstable. </p>
              <p> because he had learned of her
                fatal heart attack while attending a parade without his parents’
                permission, the 12-year-old King attempted suicide by jumping from a
                second-story window. In 1944, at age 15, King entered Morehouse College
                in Atlanta under a special wartime program intended to boost enrollment
                by admitting promising high-school students like King.</p> <p>Before beginning
                  college, however, King spent the summer on a tobacco farm in
                  Connecticut; it was his first extended stay away from home and his first
                  substantial experience of race relations outside the segregated South.
                  He was shocked by how peacefully the races mixed in the North. “Negroes
                  and whites go [to] the same church,” he noted in a letter to his
                  parents. “I never [thought] that a person of my race could eat
                  anywhere.” This summer experience in the North only deepened King’s
                  growing hatred of racial segregation.</p>
